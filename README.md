# Welcome to Quizuki!

This is the successor of now discontinued [Kuizu](https://github.com/niceWizzard/kuizu). 


Note: This app is still in development version and is unstable.

Features not implemented yet (but in Kuizu)
* End game results
* Deleting plays (sessions)
* ~~Pregame results~~
* ~~Adding quizzes from Wayground (Quizizz)~~


## Changes from Kuizu
1. The app is made in Expo (React Native). Kuizu was made in Jetpack Compose which made it difficult to develop alone, thus the change.
2. A lot better animations and ui layout.
3. Paste button when adding quizzes!
